Howdy, I'm student of chemical engineering from São Paulo, Brazil, living in Vancouver. This blog is for documentation about my thoughts and reflections, and journy through my academic life. I made this website using Jekyll hosted on github, using the [Jekyll Kisé ](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/jekyll-klise/)theme, and using HTML and such for template editing and post making.

If you have a question about me or else, just reach me out.
