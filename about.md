Howdy, I'm student of chemical engineering from São Paulo, Brazil, living in Vancouver. This blog is for documentation about my thoughts and reflections, and journy through my academic life. I made this website using Jekyll hosted on github, using the [report](http://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise/issues/new) theme

If you have a question about me or else, just reach me.

You can [report](http://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise/issues/new) if there is an broken link(s) or somethings else.
