Hello, you must have clicked this wondering "servicesï¼Ÿ How can this part japanese second-year engineering boy provide me anything?", Yes.

- Being fluent on the japanese language since the age of 12, I can give **private japanese tutoring** for any levels, the first class being *FREE!* and for newbies, promising fluency in Hiragana and Katakana in just two lessons! I used to be a teacher assistant for a local japa school for kids in brazil back then, so I'm experienced with teaching newcomers to the language.
- Same as the system above, I can also provide **private Portuguese tutoring**, since it's my mother language.
- If you are situated on the *UBC Vancouver campus*, you can bring me your computer or laptop for any **repair, a cleanup or a component installation like an SSD!**.
